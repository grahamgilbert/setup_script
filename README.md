# setup_script
A script to get a mac set up for my use

## Usage

I know curling to bash is wrong and bad, but it's easier this way

```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grahamgilbert/setup_script/master/setup.sh | sudo bash -s <APPSTORENAME> <APPSTOREPASSWORD>
```

You should then forget the command from your history (as it contains your App Store credentials)

```
$ history
$ history -d <WHATEVER THE COMMAND WAS>
```
